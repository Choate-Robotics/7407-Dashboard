# 7407 Dashboard

Dashboard/HUB for FRC team 7407. Keep in mind that this program will be run on **Windows only** during the competition. However, we can develop it on a Mac or Linux because PySide2 is a cross platform library.

Compatible with Python3.5+ as of now. Please don't use function annotations as it was added in Python3.6

Usage:

```sh
python3 .
```

or 

```sh
python3 __main__.py
```

Dependancies:

- `PySide2`
- `shapely`
